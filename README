Before being able to run this docker container
a ".env" file needs to be made. It should be called .env (nothing before the dot).
cp the example.env to .env
Then alter the file to include the correct information.

Then do:
docker build . -t test_build
and 
docker-compose run metrics

That will take you into the docker environment (source folder of the metrics repo).
From there you can run any program in that folder.


------------------

If want to run a shell script. Here is an exmple with capturing the redirect in the environment that called Docker.

docker-compose > user_info_dump.txt run metrics ../bin/dump_query_results.sh

Put executables in the bin directory we will call scripts this way for the CRON jobs
