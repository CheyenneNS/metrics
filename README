Before being able to run this docker container
a ".env" file needs to be made. It should be called .env (nothing before the dot).
cp the example.env to .env
Then alter the file to include the correct information.

Then do:
docker build . -t test_build
and 
docker-compose run metrics

That will take you into the docker environment (source folder of the metrics repo).
From there you can run any program in that folder.
